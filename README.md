## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+ (for development)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   cd 7th Brain-link-tracker-backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
   - The analytics dashboard will load automatically

## üìä Usage

### Creating Tracking Links

1. **Pixel Tracking (Email Opens)**
   ```html
   <img src="http://localhost:5000/track/pixel/YOUR_TOKEN" width="1" height="1" style="display:none;" />
   ```

2. **Click Tracking**
   ```html
   <a href="http://localhost:5000/track/click/YOUR_TOKEN">Your Link Text</a>
   ```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /track/pixel/<token>` - Email open tracking (returns 1x1 PNG)
- `GET /track/click/<token>` - Link click tracking (redirects to original URL)
- `GET /api/analytics` - Get comprehensive analytics data
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Sample Tracking Token
Use `test123token456` for testing (pre-configured in the database).

- Security scanners (VirusTotal, URLVoid, Hybrid Analysis)

### Advanced Bot Detection
Detects and blocks:
- Command-line tools (curl, wget, httpie)
- Programming libraries (python-requests, axios)
- Automated browsers (Selenium, PhantomJS)
- Security scanners and crawlers
- Missing or suspicious HTTP headers

### IP Reputation System

1. **Overview Cards**
   - Total clicks and email opens
   - Unique visitors and conversion rates
   - Blocked requests and risk scores

2. **Interactive Charts**
   - Hourly activity with stacked area charts
   - Geographic distribution with progress bars
   - Device type breakdown with pie charts

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Real-time security event feed
   - Bot detection statistics
   - Blocked request analysis

4. **Live Activity Feed**
   - Real-time event streaming
   - Geographic and device information
   - Security incident alerts

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Production Deployment
1. Set environment variables for production database
2. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
3. Use WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
4. Enable HTTPS for secure tracking

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: Production database connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Application secret key
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to 'production' for production deployment

## üîß Configuration

Edit `src/main.py` to customize:
- Security thresholds and rules
- Rate limiting parameters
- Blocked referrer lists
- Bot detection patterns
- Database configuration

## üìù Database Schema

The system uses SQLite by default with these tables:
- `campaigns`: Campaign management
- `tracking_links`: Link and token storage
- `tracking_events`: All tracking events and analytics
- `ip_reputation`: IP reputation and security data

## üõ° Security Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS** in production for secure tracking
2. **Rotate tokens** regularly for enhanced security
3. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Configure firewalls** to block known bad actors
5. **Regular updates** to maintain security effectiveness
